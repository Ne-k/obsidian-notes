#Notes #Permaculture 

- Permaculture (Permanent Agriculture):  is a design system

- Producing edible landscapes, mirroring the natural ecosystems in their diversity and production

- Uses a set of principles and practices to design sustainable human settlements.

- Use protracted and thoughtful observation rather than prolonged and thoughtless action.

- Designed for specific sites, clients, and cultures. 

- Reuse old greenhouse materials, and use rocks and other natural materials.

1. **Observe**
	1. 

2. **Connect**
	- Use relative location, that is, place the elements of your design in ways that create useful relationships and time saving connections among all parts
	- Plant more natives between sites
	- `Inebriating water use`

3. **Catch and store energy and materials**
	- Identify, collect, and hold useful flows. 
	- E.g. utilize slopes, temperatures sinks and solar radiation locales. 
	- Slope help with run-off, and collecting water.
	- `Greenhouse(s) roofs, maple, green roof.`

4. **Each element performs multiple functions**
	- Stack elements in both space and time. 
	- Use the connections between the diverse components to create a stable whole. 
	- `Green roof, education, mulch, clover, hillside.`

5. **Each function is supported by multiple elements**
	- Redundancy protects when one or more elements fail. 
	- Diversity - more than one type nitrogen fixer. 

6. **Make the least change for the greatest effect**
	- Understand the system you are working with well enough to find its "leverage points" and intervene there, where the least amount of work will be needed. 
	- `Planting natives, more shade, more control, creating better soil, water catchment, bioswale`

7. **Small-scale**
	- Start with small things that build success and create yield. 
	- `WL HS`

8. **Optimize edge**
	- Edges are the most diverse places in a system because energy and material tend to accumulate there
	- `More edibles`

9. **Collaborate with succession**
	- Mature ecosystems are more diverse and productive than young or simple ones
