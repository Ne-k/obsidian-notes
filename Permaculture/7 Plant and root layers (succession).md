#Notes #Permaculture 
7 layers of plants **catch the sun**, 7 layers of roots pump up nutrients.

Maximum sun and soil use: 
- Big trees (walnut, buartnut, etc.)
- Small trees (apple, pear, plum, etc)
- Climbing trees plants (grape, kiwi, bramble, etc.)
- Bushes (rasp-, gooseberries, etc.)
- Herb layer (herbs, vegetables, etc.) 
- Ground "crawlers" (pumpkin, cucumber, etc.) 
- Root layer (potatoes, carrots, etc.)

- Having 7 layers of vegetation creates many different habitats for a while variety of different insects, birds, mammals, etc. 
- If the sun is coming from the south, plant the largest tree to the north, and scale down to the smallest going to the south, and any more big trees can be around northwest ,west, and northeast, creating a **sun trap**. ([[SunTrap.excalidraw]])
